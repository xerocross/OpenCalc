OpenCalc
========
The purpose of this project is to create a free and open calculus textbook.  As of this writing, the specifics of *how* to do that are still being decided.  I'm the founder and manager of this project, Adam Cross.  I'm an analyst and I've taught calculus at Louisiana State University.  The idea is simple.  I welcome any contribution that add something that should be in a calculus textbook but which has not been added yet to this project.  I also welcome contributions that improve upon existing content.  I also welcome exercises for the student.

I will act as editor-in-chief and I will curate the content.  I believe in being as clear as possible.  I believe in including lots of illustrations.  I will probably add many of my own crude hand drawings that I have created to give to my students in lecture notes and quizzes and practice homework.  I certainly welcome anyone who wants to replace those with professional-looking images.
